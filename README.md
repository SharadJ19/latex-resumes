# Resume (LaTeX) 📄

This repository contains my resumes written in **LaTeX**, maintained in **GitHub** for clean version history and easy iteration.  
I use **Overleaf** to edit and compile these files.

## Resume Files 🗂️

- `sde_fullstack.tex`  
  💻 General **SDE / Full Stack** roles

- `backend.tex`  
  ⚙️ **Backend-focused** roles (APIs, systems, data, infra)

- `frontend.tex`  
  🎨 **Frontend-focused** roles (UI, React, performance, UX)

Each file is fully self-contained and can be compiled independently.

## Workflow 🔁

- ✍️ Edit resumes in Overleaf  
- 🔗 Sync changes to this GitHub repository  
- 🕒 Use Git history to track improvements and role-specific tweaks

## Notes 📝

- 🧱 No shared LaTeX components by design (kept simple)
- 🚫 PDFs are not tracked in the repo
- 📌 File names are stable to keep diffs clean
